"""Defines a graph representation of how microgrid components are connected.

The component graph is an approximate representation of the microgrid circuit,
abstracted to a level appropriate for higher-level monitoring and control.
Examples of use-cases would be:

  * using the graph structure to infer which component measurements
    need to be combined to obtain grid power or onsite load

  * identifying which inverter(s) need to be engaged to (dis)charge
    a particular battery

  * understanding which power flows in the microgrid are derived from
    green and grey sources

It deliberately does not include all pieces of hardware placed in the microgrid,
instead limiting itself to just those that are needed to monitor and control the
flow of power.
